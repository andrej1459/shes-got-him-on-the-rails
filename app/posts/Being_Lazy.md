# Software Engineering

## Problem Solving 

The first thing we learnt about was how to **problem solve**. Simply, you just need to break large problems down into smaller 
ones which are much more manageable and easy to solve. It often helps to write all of these sub-problems down so that when 
you come back to solving the problem some time later, you dont have to start over again. This can also help the problem to 
be split up and allocated to different people. Its also a great idea to make this into some kind of check list to help keep
yourself motivated and on time. 

## Being Lazy

Next we learnt that the secret to being a good software engineer is "being lazy".

- Minimse the work you do.
- If someone has already written code to do what you want, use that instead.
- Dont shoot yourself in the foot (dont be so lazy that you make more work for yourself later!)
