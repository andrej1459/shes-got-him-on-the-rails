## Problem Solving

In our first session at Villiers, we explored how being lazy and problem solving are very closely linked.
Most big problems are just groups of smaller problems that need to be solved. These smaller problems---or groups of problems---then all come together to solve the overall, original problem.
When beginning to look at problem, there are many questions that you have to ask yourself.

For example:
* Who will be using the code?
* Has it already been written?
* What constraints will have to be faced? (Hardware, time...)
* What exactly is needed from the code? 

## Being Lazy

Being lazy boils down to how you can get the **best** work done possible with the **least** amount of effort. However, this could involve putting in *many hours* of work early on in a project, which may seem contradictory to being lazy, but those hours early on could save *weeks* of work six months down the line.
Groupwork can be integral to being lazy, why take on 20 tasks yourself when those tasks could be divided between 4 people? Or why write a whole lot of code when somebody has already written it for you?

## Markdown

Markdown is a language that makes sense to both humans and computers. It is very intuitive and mostly anybody could make sense of how it works in a small time frame, yet a computer can make sense of what the different hashes and equals signs and format the text accordingly.
It is also very versatile, as anything written in Markdown can then be translated to HTML.
