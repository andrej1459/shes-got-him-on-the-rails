### Problem Solving

We were told that in order to solve a problem we had to break it up into *indivisible* problems.
This could then be divided and worked on by several different member on a team.
Methinks this has some relevance to the upcoming group project...

### Being Lazy

He basically just said 'Do what you're good at Isaac'. Bonza.
