Markdown
=======

Markdown is a language-ish type thing that converts to HTML and other stuff easily
It can be read easily by both humans and computers. Used by reddit -> I like this.

Syntax
------

'======' means a Heading
'------' means a Sub-heading
'###' some other form of heading
'     ' basically a blanc line for a new paragraph. Tidy.
'  ' linebreak or something... I don't know...
'*word*' does italics
'**word**' does bold
''word'' does monospace
[link](can you guess what this does)

### That'll do Donkey. That'll do.
