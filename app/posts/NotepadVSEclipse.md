Notepad++

I am very familiar with Notepad++ as I use it for modding various games such as Terraria, Starbound, and Project Zomboid.
It is a very useful text editor as it can modify all kinds of files. It allows 'tabbed editing' meaning you can modify multiple
files at once. It also has a colour code for different 

Notepad++ has:

   * Tabbed document interface[7]
   * Drag-and-drop
   * Multiple clipboards (plugin required)
   * Split screen editing and synchronized scrolling
   * Spell checker (requires Aspell) (Spell checker does not distinguish between text and code)
   * Supports text encoding formats such as Unicode, for international writing systems. UTF-8 and several UTF-16 encodings are supported.
   * Find and replace: with regular expressions (including multi-line); over multiple documents; and marking/summary of occurrences
   * Data comparison
   * Zooming

Eclipse

Eclipse is written mostly in Java but can be written in almost any other language. People love Eclipse due to it's easy UI

'I like Eclipse because it has lots of buttons' - Jess 2015

The Eclipse runtime system is based on Equinox and uses plug-ins to provide all the functionality needed.

It's decent I guess.
