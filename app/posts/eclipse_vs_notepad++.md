##Eclipse Vs Notepad++

Elipse
--------
From past experiences in the computing world, I have come to know and love the eclispe IDE very much. I find it
not only easy to use but easy upon eye as there are various buttons that are available.It helps by highlighting the key
words in the code such as *for* and *while* loops therefore you never quite lose your place in the code. I also think that
the code looks fairly goodlooking.The buttons at the top are fairly obvious and help you debug, run and various other functions 
that save you time on searching on how to do things. 
Here are the various features on eclispe;
•Software Updates
•Java enterprise Tooling
•Model Driven Development 
•JUnit Intergration
•Perspectives

Notepad++
-------
I have never used notepad++ before and after spending so much time using eclispe, i don't think that I will ever quite like
a text editor more than I do IDE. It just doesn't look that pretty to look at as the IDE would make the code and therefore 
because it just looks like a bunch of random words I would lose myself easily. There are no easy buttons to use at the top either
and so i think I would waste more time on finding how to do things other than writing the code. Text Editor is definitely NOT my
thing.

Here are the various features on notepad++;
•Auto-completion: Word completion, Function completion and  Function parameters hint
•Multi-Document (Tab interface)
•Multi-View
•WYSIWYG (Printing)
•Zoom in and zoom out
•Multi-Language environment supported
•Bookmark
