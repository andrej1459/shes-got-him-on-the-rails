##Markdown, a quick cheat sheet

First things first, is writing the headings. Use the # to denote a heading, and use more hashes for a deeper heading (## for
subheading). Then you just need to write the text, each paragraph is separated by a blank line. You can also add different 
text attributes:
	
 - To write in *Italic* just use * before and after the text.
 - To write in **bold**, use two stars.
 - To add a strikethrough, use ~~ before and after the text.
