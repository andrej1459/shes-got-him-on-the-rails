## Creating a new blog

In order to set up a new blog, we followed the Hello World tutorial. We tried following it directly, however, due to issues with permissions, it would not allow us to do what we wanted to do.

So instead we had to use "visudo" to set the debian user to have permission to use sudo (the same powers as root). We then had to copy the 25 command lines before exiting.

This meant we could make a new rails blog in debian using the command "rails new rails_blog". Then it prompted us for a password which we were now able to enter.

And finally our new blog was created. We continued following the tutorial and IT WORKED!
