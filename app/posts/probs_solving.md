#Problem Solving and Being Lazy
##Problem Solving

In our first task at Villiers Park, we were told that the two main parts of software engineering is problem solving
and being lazy, by our tutor *Billy*.The main pointers we were given in doing problem solving was splitting the entirity 
of the problem into smaller sub-sections with various questions to ask ourselves. These were:
* Who are we doing it for?
* How fast should it be?
* Is there code that we could already be using?

##Being Lazy
Being "Lazy" is writing code in the fastest and easier way possible, however, is not in the absence of doing awful pointless
code. It means that the code that we do provide is of excellent standard, just done in a faster and in a more logical way.
It is a key part of programming, for example, would you rewrite code that was already available to use?

##Mark Down
Mark down is what I am writing in right now and has various benefits to its use. One of these is that it can be easily transformed
into code but is also easy to read by the user. It is a versatile language that can be transformed into HTML as well. it is often used to format 
read files and to write messages.
