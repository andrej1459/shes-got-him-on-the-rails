##RAILS

So what is Ruby on Rails? Well it is an add on to the Ruby language which is 11 years old in 5 months time.It is used for web
development and is very rarely used because not many are able to achieve the skills required to program in it. The fact
that the programming language has developed its own web development section without adjusting the original codes which can't be 
said for a programming language such as PHP is amazing because you are able to adjust between.However, one of the best things 
about Rails is that it not only saves you time but brain power because a lot of the code has already been developed, therefore, 
as I have learnt today, you are able to be lazy to the full extent.This ios due to its amazing sense of community and many people
wanting to develop and advance the software.
