##Text Editor vs. IDE

###Sublime Text (text editor)
Sublime Text is firstly a very attractive text editor and so is very nice to use visually.
It has a great deal of impressive features, making the user experience very slick and
easy. The Goto Anything feature can be used to open files quickly and easily and allows you
to quickly jump to any word or line you want to find. There are lots of commands which makes 
this text editor very quick to use!

Split editting is another useful feature which allows you to edit multiuple files side by 
side or just of different locations in the same file. In addition to this, the Command 
Palette helps you to quickly find infrequently used functionality, meaning you dont have to 
traul through menus to find them.

###Eclipse (IDE)
