##Version Control Software

Version Control Software is very useful for a number of reasons:
 - It can be used to backup and restore files, they are saved as they are editted so you can restore a file back to how it was at any time in the past.
 - Its great to stay synchronized as it lets people share files and keep up-to-date with the latest version.
 - It makes it easy to undo editting, whether it was a short term change, or a change you made a year ago!
 - You can track changes easily and can also tag these changes with the name of the person who made it.

## Git 

When deciding on which version control software to use, we considered most importantly, which had the best name. So, Git it was.Having said this, Git does have its positives, its very fast. As nearly all operations are performed locally, it doesnt constantly need to communicate with a server, so has a large time advantage!
